To run the Practical Probabilistic Programming examples:

1) Install SBT v0.13.8 for your chosen operating system
2) Open a command line prompt
3) Navigate to the "examples" directory
4) At the command prompt, type
	a) sbt "runMain <class_with_main> <parameters>"

Note: don't forget the quotes around the runMain command!

To test if your local environment is properly configured:

	sbt "runMain Test"

You should see the following output
